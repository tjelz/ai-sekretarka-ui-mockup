---

**Next Steps for Product Team:**
1. Monitor competitor pricing changes (quarterly)
2. Scrape competitor landing pages for messaging analysis
3. Mystery shop competitor onboarding (experience their process)
4. Track market share via search volume and brand mentions
5. Build competitive sales battlecards for team
6. A/B test competitive comparison sections on landing pages

- No dominant Polish player yet
- SMB digital urgency post-COVID sustained
