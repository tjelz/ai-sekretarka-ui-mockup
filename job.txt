AI SECRETARY JOBS:

1.Create a profit calculator beside the pricing table.

Inputs:
- avg_price (number, default 125)
- conversion (number %, default 40)

Plans:
- Solo: price=299, calls=100
- Team: price=599, calls=225
- Studio: price=999, calls=500
- overage_per_call = 1.5 (show only as note)

Formula:
conv_rate = conversion / 100
visits = floor(calls * conv_rate)
revenue = visits * avg_price
profit = revenue - price

UI:
- Display each plan as a card with:
  - price
  - calls included
  - visits
  - revenue
  - profit (highlight)

- Recalculate on input change (no page refresh).
